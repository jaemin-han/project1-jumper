## Description & Instruction

- Input your name & favorite food and click 'Play Now' to begin the game.
- Single player game. The player needs to click arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move across the street to accumulate points.
- Crossing the street safely once will get a player 1 point.
-  Safely reaching the NYC building at the bottom of the page without hitting any obstacles, the player will be awarded 1 point.
- The main goal of this game is to collect points while avoiding obstacles along the way.

- Loop: Create multiple boxes in the javascript file
- Randomization: Obstacles’ speed & priority* across the window

**Unsolved Problems**

- Continue to work on the setInterval for my randomized obstacles. At this moment, it only works once.
- Work on Media Query to make my game responsive.
- Unable to fully understand the Get/Post form which I referenced from the previous lab exercise.
